Hello, I am Larry and I am 67 years old and this is like teaching an old dog a new trick.   This all seems too much for me, but I am willing to give it a real try.  I am having real difficulty trying to understand code, it is a whole new language to me.  Some of it is beginning to make some sense.  But I know that I have a long way to go.  I am working on a project.  This project is a type of robot that has 4 dc motors and 2 steppers.  I have 2 adafruit motor shields to stack onto a arduino uno.  I want to control the motors speed and direction with two joysticks using a pair of nrf24lo1 transceivers.  I have no idea how to write the code for this project.
